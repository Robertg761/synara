// FILE: dockPaneOpenRequest.ts
// Purpose: One routing rule for every agent-triggered "open my dock pane" request.
// Layer: Web chat surface logic
// Exports: routeSingleDockPaneOpenRequest, DockPaneCrossThreadPolicy
// Depends on: nothing (pure)

/**
 * What a pane does when the request names a thread other than the one on screen.
 *
 * - `remember`: record the request for the requested thread without touching the
 *   current chat. The browser panel uses this — its native runtime stays on the
 *   requested thread, so returning to that chat should restore the panel, but
 *   there is nothing to gain by stealing the user's current chat merely to make
 *   the browser visible. No hydration, no navigation.
 * - `navigate`: seed the requested thread's dock and route there. The device and
 *   computer panes use this — the event carries its own thread, so an agent
 *   driving a desktop from a background thread lands the user on the thread that
 *   is actually doing the work rather than showing nothing at all.
