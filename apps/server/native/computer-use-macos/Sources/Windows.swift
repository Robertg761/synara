// Window enumeration via CGWindowList.
//
// The on-screen window list is the macOS analog of the KWin plugin's window
// document: id, title, owning app + pid, global bounds, and a stacking order.
// CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo already returns windows front-to-back, which gives
// a stacking index for free and lets the input path resolve which window a bare
// coordinate would hit.
//
// Two properties this file is responsible for:
//
//   1. **No helper instance's windows are in the list.** The Software Cursor
//      overlay is a normal-level NSWindow parked exactly at the point the agent
//      is about to act on and ordered frontmost, so an unfiltered `topmost(at:)`
//      resolves *our own overlay* as the click target and `CGEventPostToPid`
//      delivers the click back to this process — the action silently never
//      reaches the app. Filtering by pid here keeps the overlay out of
//      `list-windows`, occluder computation, `describe-ui`, and every hit test
//      at once. (It stays visible in captures: that is the point of the overlay,
//      and `sharingType = .readOnly` keeps it in the frame.) A *second* copy of
//      the helper is filtered the same way, by executable path — see
//      `isHelperProcess`.
//   2. **One CGWindowList round trip per gesture.** A click resolves a target,
//      stamps it on two events, and re-checks it for keyboard routing; a drag
//      does that plus one event per step. A ~30 ms memo makes the repeats free
//      while staying short enough that the next gesture sees the stacking the
//      previous one changed.
