// The "Software Cursor" overlay — a picture, not a pointer.
//
// macOS runs exactly one real cursor and the agent never moves it. Following
// Codex's confirmed configuration (reference §2.2), this is a borderless,
// click-through NSWindow the helper draws wherever the agent is about to act, so
// the human can watch without the two fighting over the pointer. A name badge
// fades in beside it so multiple agents are distinguishable from day one (Codex
// shipped without this and immediately got a bug filed).
//
// The window is `ignoresMouseEvents` (the human's real clicks pass through) and
// `sharingType = .readOnly` (so the agent's own screenshots can include it while
// staying out of the human's way). All AppKit mutation happens on the main
// thread; callers may invoke `move`/`glide`/`setName`/`repin` from any queue.
//
// Two things this file is really about, beyond drawing an arrow:
//
//   * **It has to look like a pointer, not like a debug marker.** The arrow is
//     rendered at runtime into `CAShapeLayer`s at the destination screen's
//     `backingScaleFactor` — the outline is a separate, wider stroke *under* the
//     fill so the accent silhouette keeps its full width (a centred stroke eats
//     half of a 4 pt tail), and the outline layer carries the drop shadow so the
//     whole glyph reads over any wallpaper. The fill's tip sits exactly on the
//     point passed to `move`, because that is where the click is posted; only
//     the white ring extends past it, which is what a real cursor does too.
//
//   * **It has to move like a hand moved it, and the click has to wait for it.**
//     A jump-cut overlay is worse than none: the human sees the arrow appear
//     somewhere it has already finished clicking. The tip is a mass on a spring
//     (see "Motion" below) integrated at a fixed 1/240 s step and driven by the
//     display's own refresh, so the motion is continuous across retargets rather
//     than a sequence of independent, hard-stopping animations. `glide` is the
//     same thing plus a semaphore the ticker signals on arrival, which lets the
//     (background, serial) input lane block until the picture is true before it
//     posts a button down. The main thread is never the one waiting — it is the
//     one integrating.
//
// The overlay is ordered immediately above its target window. It must never
// cover a window the human has put above that target, including between calls.

  // MARK: - Motion
  //
  // The tip is a mass on a spring pulled toward the target, integrated with
  // symplectic (semi-implicit) Euler at a fixed 1/240 s step, sub-stepped from
  // the *real* elapsed time of each display refresh. Three properties fall out
  // of that and none of them were true of the old fixed-duration tween:
  //
  //   1. **Velocity is state, so it survives a retarget.** Consecutive gestures
  //      flow into one another instead of decelerating to a dead stop at every
  //      waypoint and starting again from zero, and a drag's stream of 12 ms
  //      updates is followed rather than restarted 30 times.
  //   2. **The integrator is driven by the display, not by a run-loop timer.**
  //      A `Timer` at 60 Hz drifts and coalesces under load, which is exactly
  //      the stutter a human reads as "not smooth"; a `CADisplayLink` fires in
  //      step with the panel (including 120 Hz ProMotion), and integrating real
  //      elapsed time means a dropped frame costs a longer step, not a lurch.
  //   3. The animation link is invalidated when the tip settles. A separate,
  //      low-frequency check keeps the overlay attached to its target window.
  //
  // The spring is deliberately *nonlinear*: its angular frequency falls off with
  // the remaining distance (ω = C·d^-α with α near ½). A linear spring cannot
  // satisfy the two ends of the brief at once — its settling time is
  // scale-invariant, so tuning it to cross 600 pt in a third of a second makes a
  // 30 pt nudge take just as long, and forcing the long move to settle to within
  // a point in that time demands a violent 5000 pt/s launch that reads as a
  // jump-cut. With α ≈ ½ the restoring *force* is nearly independent of
  // distance, i.e. the tip accelerates and brakes at a roughly constant effort —
  // the bang-bang-plus-damping shape that models goal-directed hand movement,
  // whose duration grows with √distance. That gives 600 pt in ~340 ms and 30 pt
  // in ~100 ms out of one law, with a symmetric bell-shaped speed profile
  // peaking near 3400 pt/s instead of 5600, and it stiffens as it closes so the
  // last point is taken crisply rather than crept up on.
  //
  // Measured from the live per-frame trace (`SYNARA_CURSOR_TRACE=1` logs the tip
  // to stderr once per frame; 60 Hz panel, frame interval median 16.70 ms):
  // 600 pt settles to within a point in 317–333 ms, 303 pt in 267 ms, 30 pt in
  // 83–100 ms, a 1909 pt corner-to-corner traverse in 400 ms. Overshoot is
  // 0.00 pt at every distance and the tip comes to rest within 0.02 pt of the
  // requested point. The largest frame-to-frame change in speed through the body
  // of a 600 pt glide is 10–11 % of its peak, and a 300 pt drag's overlay never
  // trails the gesture by more than 7.2 pt (2.4 %).
