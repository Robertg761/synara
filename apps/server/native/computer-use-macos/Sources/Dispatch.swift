// Request lanes.
//
// One serial queue for everything was the original shape, and it made the two
// halves of the helper fight each other: the pane's still-frame capture runs
// every 500 ms for as long as the computer pane is open, so with a single queue
// every click and keystroke queued behind a screenshot, and one slow AX walk
// stalled every capture behind it. The protocol correlates by request id and
// `writeMessage` is locked, so responses are free to complete out of order —
// the only ordering that has to hold is *within* a lane.
//
//   * **input** — one serial queue, arrival order. Clicks, keys, drags, and the
//     clipboard are a sequence the agent expects to happen in the order it asked
//     for, and they mutate shared state (the keyboard target, the held-button
//     bookkeeping) that is only safe because it has exactly one writer.
//   * **perception** — concurrent. Captures, window lists, and pings are pure
//     reads; a `ping` must answer while a capture is in flight, which is exactly
//     what the watchdog on the Node side is measuring.
//   * **accessibility** — its own serial queue, for the `describe-ui` walk. An
//     AX walk is synchronous IPC into other processes and can take hundreds of
//     milliseconds even bounded; the reference is explicit that it belongs off
//     the capture path, and serialising it keeps one runaway app from
//     multiplying into several blocked threads.
//
// This lane owns the *walk*, not accessibility in general. Bounded AX round
// trips run on the input lane by design — the typing ladder's read-back, the
// click's delivery watch, the keyboard focus nudge — because each one is part
// of the action it belongs to and has to happen in that action's order. Every
// one of them carries the per-window messaging timeout and a wall-clock budget
// for exactly that reason.
//
// stdin stays on its own reader thread: it only parses and hands off, so a busy
// lane never stops the helper from noticing the next request or a closed pipe.
