// Non-disruptive synthetic input.
//
// This is the whole trick, and it is the literal port of what Codex does on
// macOS (confirmed by the reverse-engineering in the design reference):
//
//   1. Build a CGEvent for the action at the global location.
//   2. Stamp its private integer fields — button (3), subtype (7=3), the target
//      pid (40), and the target window id (51, 91, 92) — plus one click-group id
//      (58) shared by every event of a gesture.
//   3. Call the private `CGEventSetWindowLocation` with window-local
//      coordinates. This one call is what delivers the event to a background
//      window; without it nothing arrives.
//   4. Post it to the *target process* with `CGEventPostToPid`, never to the HID
//      tap. WindowServer warps the real pointer only as a side effect of
//      HID-stream events, so posting to a pid keeps the human's cursor still.
//
// The real cursor is never touched: no `CGWarpMouseCursorPosition`, no HID-tap
// posting. The agent's visible cursor is the overlay in Cursor.swift, moved in
// lockstep with these posts.
//
// Three rules the gesture layer enforces on top of that:
//
//   * **One target per gesture.** The window is resolved once, at the point the
//     gesture starts, and every event of that gesture is stamped with it. That
//     is how macOS routes a real drag (the window that took the mouse-down owns
//     every dragged event and the up), and it means a click cannot deliver its
//     down and its up to two different windows if something restacks in the
//     middle of it.
//   * **A background target is made to believe it is active *and* key, then put
//     back.** AppKit hit-tests mouse events against the tracking state a window
//     last saw and only routes keys to an app it thinks is active, so every
//     gesture at a window whose app is not frontmost is wrapped in the focus
//     records from SkyLight.swift — the activate/deactivate pair *and* the
//     key-window pair — primed with a `mouseMoved`, and followed by the inverse
//     pair (or, if the click genuinely raised the app, by re-activating the
//     human's previous app). The key-window half is what makes this work on
//     Chromium and Electron: with the activate record alone a background web
//     page receives no `mousedown` at all, and with both it behaves like any
//     other window. WindowServer's z-order and the current Space are never
//     changed by any of it.
//   * **Nothing stays held.** A mouse button or modifier that is logically down
//     is tracked, and the unwind path posts the matching up on SIGTERM/SIGINT or
//     when stdin closes. The classic failure is an agent dying between a
//     modifier-down and its up, latching the modifier so every subsequent human
//     keystroke becomes a shortcut.
//
// Typing is a ladder, invisible rungs first: an accessibility `AXSelectedText`
// insert into the focused text element, which lands in a background AppKit view
// and can be read back; then pid-routed keystrokes, which now reach a background
// web view too; and, only when the caller asks for `deliveryMode: "foreground"`
// or an application has already been caught dropping both, a brief real
// activation of the target that is undone afterwards. The result names the rung
// that ran.
