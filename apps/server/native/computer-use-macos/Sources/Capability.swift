// Capability and permission probe.
//
// Two consumers: the one-shot `--probe` (read by the build and the settings
// checklist) and the live `capabilities` RPC the backend reads to seed
// `health.captureAvailable` and to decide availability. Both report the same
// facts — arch, macOS version, which TCC grants are present, and how this build
// is signed.
//
// The grants themselves belong to the *app*, not to this bundle: macOS
// attributes a TCC check to the responsible process, which for a helper spawned
// inside `Synara.app` is Synara. (Run this binary straight from Terminal and it
// reports Terminal's grants.) Asking from in here is still the right place —
// this is the process that will actually call the APIs — but the identity the
// user sees in Privacy & Security is the app's.
