// Accessibility perception and semantic actuation.
//
// AX is the macOS analog of AT-SPI on the Linux side: the structure source the
// agent reads to decide what to do, and the path for a few semantic writes
// (`set-value`, `perform-action`) where a physical click is the wrong tool.
// Physical clicks/typing/scrolling still go through synthetic input — the
// reference's "prefer simulating physical clicks over Accessibility actions" —
// so this file is only structure plus the two semantic writes.
//
// Every AX element reports its frame in global top-left points already, so a
// node's coordinates flow straight to the pointer path with no conversion. The
// node path is the child-index route from the window root, which lets the Node
// backend re-address a control on a fresh read without holding a live handle.
//
// The walk is bounded on every axis, because AX is synchronous IPC into other
// processes and a single unresponsive app would otherwise stall the agent's
// whole perception step (reference §4.3):
//
//   * `AXUIElementSetMessagingTimeout` — 1 s per application, 0.35 s per window.
//   * One IPC per node: role, title, description, value, position, size, and
//     children come back from a single `AXUIElementCopyMultipleAttributeValues`
//     instead of seven round trips.
//   * `AXUIElementIsAttributeSettable` — the extra IPC that answers "is this
//     editable" — only for roles that can plausibly hold a value.
//   * 2048 nodes per window (the AT-SPI helper's limit) marked in band with
//     `"truncated": true` on the window node, and ~6000 for the whole desktop.
//   * Subtrees whose frame lies entirely outside their window are skipped
//     (off-screen scroll content), while zero-size containers are still
//     descended — a layout wrapper with no frame routinely holds real controls.
//   * Skipped children keep their sibling index, so `nodePath` stays the real
//     child-index route and `set-value`/`perform-action` re-resolve correctly.
