# Synara computer-use plugin for Hyprland

The Hyprland twin of `../computer-use-kwin`: the agent drives the human's real
desktop with its own drawn ghost cursor and its own input path, never the seat
the human is sitting at. It exposes the identical D-Bus surface —
`org.synara.ComputerUse` at `/org/synara/ComputerUse`, interface
`org.synara.ComputerUse1`, the same sixteen methods and `sessionStopped`
signal — so the server's whole KWin driving path is reused; only loading
differs (`hyprctl plugin load`, which takes effect live with no relogin).

Build with `make` against the installed Hyprland's headers (`pkg-config
hyprland`). The plugin ABI churns per Hyprland release, so builds are
per-version, like the KWin plugin's prebuilts.

Status: the plugin itself is feature-complete — window enumeration, session
lifecycle (idle timeout, Meta+Shift+Esc release/resume chord), the ghost cursor
(arrow + name badge, scale-aware, hold-then-fade), direct per-client input
injection (raw wire events on the target client's own
`wl_pointer`/`wl_keyboard` resources, seat-manager serials, xkb modifier
mirror — the compositor's seat state is never touched), and the capture
pipeline (offscreen GPU render of a window snapshot or each monitor's full
scene, read back and composited in cairo with the ghost cursor overlaid, so
captures show the agent's pointer exactly where the human sees it; the human's
cursor is never in the offscreen scene). What remains is server-side wiring:
a `hyprland` backend tier with auto-detection and `hyprctl plugin load`
provisioning.

Development testing runs in a disposable nested Hyprland (nested inside a
headless `kwin_wayland --virtual` parent — Hyprland cannot boot headless on a
busy seat), never against the live desktop.
