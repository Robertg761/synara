/**
 * Which computer backend this Linux host gets, decided once at startup.
 *
 * One rule outranks everything here: **the agent never drives the seat the
 * human is sitting at.** Every backend this module can resolve gives the agent
 * a seat of its own — a compositor plugin's dedicated seat on a KDE or
 * Hyprland session, or a private nested compositor everywhere else. There is
 * no shared-seat backend: anything that attached virtual devices to the
 * human's own `wl_seat` would move their real cursor, so no such backend
 * exists in the tree to be selected, forced, or fallen back to.
 *
 * Beyond that rule, an explicit ordered resolution with **no fallback in any
 * direction**. Falling back from a nested session to the real desktop would
 * hand an agent the human's screen right after an operator asked for an
 * isolated one; falling the other way would hide a broken desktop behind a
 * session nobody can see. A tier that fails stays failed, and the backend it
 * produces explains why — on a host without `kwin_wayland`, the nested
 * backend's failure names the package to install rather than quietly picking
 * something that would touch the human's seat.
 *
 * The auto-detection asks the session bus who owns `org.kde.KWin` rather than
 * reading `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP`. The compositor is the thing that decides
 * whether the KWin plugin can load; the env var is a label a login manager sets
 * and a user can override, and on a KDE session started from a tty it is often
 * simply absent.
