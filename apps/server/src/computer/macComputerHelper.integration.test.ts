/**
 * The real macOS helper, end to end, over its real JSON-RPC stdio protocol.
 *
 * **Perception only.** This test never sends an input RPC — no `move`, `click`,
 * `double-click`, `right-click`, `drag`, `scroll`, `type`, `press-key`,
 * `hotkey`, `set-value`, `perform-action`, `focus-window`, `raise-window`,
 * `write-clipboard`, `launch-app` or `set-agent-cursor` — so it is safe to run
 * against the desktop the developer is sitting in. It talks to
 * `MacComputerHelperClient` directly rather than to `MacComputerBackend`, so no
 * lease is taken, no still-frame loop starts, and nothing touches focus; the
 * helper's agent-cursor overlay exists but stays hidden, because it is only
 * shown by `set-agent-cursor`, which is in the forbidden set below.
 * `FORBIDDEN_METHODS` is asserted against every request the test makes, so a
 * future edit cannot quietly add one.
 *
 * What it is for: the helper `dlsym`s private SkyLight SPI and links
 * ScreenCaptureKit, and the parsers on the Node side (`parseWindows`,
 * `parseMacUiForest`, `readPngDimensions`) encode assumptions about what the
 * Swift answers with. Unit tests cover both sides against fixtures; only this
 * covers the seam.
 *
 * Off unless `SYNARA_MAC_HELPER_TEST` is set, and skipped when no helper binary
 * can be found. Build one first:
 *
 *   bash apps/server/native/computer-use-macos/build.sh /tmp/synara-helper
 *   SYNARA_MAC_HELPER_TEST=1 \
 *   SYNARA_MAC_HELPER_BINARY=/tmp/synara-helper/synara-computer-helper \
 *   bun run --cwd apps/server test src/computer/macComputerHelper.integration.test.ts
 *
 * Grants are not a precondition. A runner has neither Accessibility nor Screen
 * Recording, and the helper answers `-32000` for the calls that need them; the
 * assertions that depend on a grant report a skip instead of failing, so the
 * same file is meaningful on CI (as a symbol tripwire) and on a granted Mac (as
 * a parser contract).
