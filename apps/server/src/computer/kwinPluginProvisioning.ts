/**
 * Getting the KWin plugin onto a machine that has never seen it.
 *
 * The bar is that a user installs the update, turns computer use on, and it
 * works. Two things stood between us and that, and this module is the answer to
 * both.
 *
 * The first was `sudo`. A KWin plugin does not have to live in `/usr`: KWin
 * finds plugins through Qt's library paths, and Qt reads `QT_PLUGIN_PATH` from
 * the environment. So the plugin goes under the user's own `~/.local`, and one
 * small script in the Plasma session's env directory puts that root on the path.
 * Nothing outside the home directory is touched, and uninstalling is deleting
 * two paths.
 *
 * The second was the compiler. A KWin plugin is a binary module tied to the
 * exact KWin it was built against, so the old flow needed cmake, ninja, and the
 * KWin development headers on the user's machine - which almost nobody has.
 * Prebuilt binaries shipped with the app cover the KWin versions we build for,
 * and building from source stays as the fallback for everything else.
 *
 * The one cost that cannot be engineered away: Qt reads `QT_PLUGIN_PATH` when
 * KWin starts, so the very first install lands in a directory the running
 * compositor was never told about. That session cannot see it, and there is no
 * way to add a library path to a process from outside it. The user logs out once
 * and never thinks about it again - every later update loads live, because the
 * path is already there.
