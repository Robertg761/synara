/**
 * MacComputerHelperClient — the only server module that knows the native macOS
 * computer-use helper's wire protocol.
 *
 * Packaged builds ship a signed universal Swift helper. Source builds retain a
 * compile-and-cache fallback for development. Private Quartz/AppKit SPI such as
 * `CGEventSetWindowLocation` is resolved at runtime so OS drift is reported as
 * a capability failure rather than a loader crash. It speaks one channel:
 *
 * - Control: newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdin/stdout. Requests carry
 *   an integer id; responses carry `result` or `error`. It also emits a `ready`
 *   notification at startup.
 *
 * Unlike the iOS device helper there is no frame socket: Tier-1 macOS capture
 * is a whole-desktop PNG still, and the backend publishes those on a timer the
 * same way the KWin backend does, so a burst of video can never share a pipe
 * with a command response because there is no video pipe at all.
 *
 * This reuses the shared `@synara/shared/jsonrpc-stdio` transport primitives —
 * the same ones the Codex app-server and device helper are built on — so the
 * framing, request correlation, and timeout logic are not a third copy.
 *
