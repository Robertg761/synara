 * The longest side, in pixels, of any screenshot handed to a model.
 *
 * This is a correctness bound before it is a cost one. Vision APIs downscale an
 * image whose long edge exceeds roughly 1568 px before the model ever sees it,
 * and the model then reads coordinates off a picture the server never produced:
 * at the old 2048 budget every pixel the model pointed at was mapped against an
 * image 1.33x larger than the one it looked at, so every click landed short and
 * consistently up-and-left. Nothing in this pipeline may depend on API-side
 * resizing — Synara does the downscale itself, records the resulting frame, and
 * maps the model's pixels through the frame it actually delivered.
 *
 * 1536 rather than something smaller because image tokens scale with area and
 * the temptation is to shrink hard: a 1024 budget did save tokens, but it lost
 * the precision needed to read a dense form or aim at a small field, and the
 * cost came back as mis-aimed clicks and extra re-screenshots that were slower
 * and more expensive than the shot they replaced. At 1536 a browser or editor
 * window comes back at full resolution, only a genuinely large capture is
 * scaled, and the real savings comes from the byte-identical dedupe
 * (`screenshotUnchanged`) that never resends an unchanged frame at all.
