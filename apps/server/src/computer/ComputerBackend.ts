 * did save tokens, but it lost the precision the agent needs to read a dense
 * form or aim at a small field, and the cost came back as mis-aimed clicks and
 * extra re-screenshots that were both slower and more expensive than the shot
 * they replaced. So this matches the height of a typical application window:
 * a browser or editor at ~1400 px tall is captured at full resolution, only a
 * genuinely large capture is scaled, and the real savings comes from the
 * byte-identical dedupe (`screenshotUnchanged`) that never resends a frame that
 * did not change — a token win with no quality cost at all. When still more
 * detail is needed, `computer_screenshot` zooms in at the perception budget with
