 * an eased path walked against a wall-clock deadline rather than a fixed sleep
 * per step, a shift that is released even when the stroke it wrapped threw, and
 * a hotkey whose modifiers come back up in the reverse of the order they went
 * down. Getting any of it wrong strands a modifier held on the user's real
