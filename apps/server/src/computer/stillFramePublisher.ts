/**
 * The still-frame stream every Tier-1 desktop backend publishes.
 *
 * A Tier-1 backend has no video encoder: it pulls a whole-desktop PNG on a
 * timer and pushes those stills at whoever is watching the pane. The loop
 * around that is identical on every display server — one interval, one capture
 * in flight at a time, a byte-identity dedupe (`StillFrameDedupe`), and the
 * `force` bookkeeping that guarantees a receiver with nothing to draw gets a
 * picture even when the desktop has not changed. It lived twice, once in the
 * KWin backend and once in the macOS one, and the two copies had already
 * drifted apart in the details.
 *
 * The part worth stating is the failure bound. Both copies re-armed the
 * deferred force whenever a forced capture threw, and the `finally` block then
 * immediately republished because a force was pending — so a desktop whose
 * captures kept failing (a revoked Screen Recording grant, a wedged compositor)
 * span in a tight recursive retry loop for as long as anyone watched the pane,
 * with no delay between attempts. Here a failed force buys exactly one immediate
 * retry; after that the request is dropped and the ordinary timer cadence takes
 * over, so a persistent failure costs two captures per interval instead of an
 * unbounded recursion.
